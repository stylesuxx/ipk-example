# Example IPK builder
This repo is meant as an example regarding workflows and IPK's.

The `Makefile` is used to build an IPK from the available data. The workflow file is meant to create a new release as soon as a new tag is pushed to the repository. It will thus trigger building the IPK and attaching it to the release.
